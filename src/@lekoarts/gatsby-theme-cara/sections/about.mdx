## ABOUT

**Hello Everyone, Myself Eshika rawat. I'm a FrontEnd Developer and I love to make connections. To bring quality to my work , I practice making Web applications.
I'm a hardworking student and I love to learn new things.**


I stumbled upon the domain of software development and designing, and I 
found myself wanting to learn more about it. I thus decided to pick up ReactJS and learn its 
basics and the core concepts through the resources available online.
Not only am I into academics, but I also enjoy participating in cultural, technical, and sports 
events. I love dancing, singing, and playing several sports like KHO-KHO, Volleyball, and Table 
Tennis. I thus believe that I am a good blend of academic and extra-curricular excellence.
